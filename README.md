# listenUp
Debate/decision-making app facilitating the exchange of arguments between users. This is the same idea as the one Hartloff proposed in class. Some features include making an argument, agreeing/disagreeing with others, as well as other features that will be though of as the project goes along.

We use zenhub as our scrum board.

The app is deployed on the Heroku server: https://cse442-listenup.herokuapp.com/
